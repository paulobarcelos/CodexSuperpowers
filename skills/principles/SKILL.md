description: Use when starting any engineering task â€” concise core principles that keep work simple, safe, and aligned: YAGNI, do-right-over-fast, ask-when-unsure, fix-then-note, evidence-before-assertions, and consistency over novelty.

# Engineering Principles

## Core
- YAGNI: build only what today needs; avoid speculative features
- Do the right thing over the fast thing; no shortcuts
- Ask when unsure; assumptions cost more than questions
- Fix broken things you touch; note unrelated fixes for later
- Evidence before assertions (pair with verification-before-completion)
- Consistency > novelty; match existing patterns and style
- Keep responses extremely concise, sacrifice grammar if needed.

## Decision Hygiene
- Write down irreversible decisions with rationale and current state
- Prefer small, reversible changes shipped frequently

## Scope Control
- Keep changesets minimal and reviewable
- Separate refactors from behavior changes when feasible
